Hi Dan,

Attached is the zipped site.

I tried fixing some of the areas to make it responsive, but still need your help with the following:

- Resizing the font size (either .5em or .75em) for the h2s for mobile
- Columns (making sure they stay in the 3 or 4 column format for web & tablet, but as one column for mobile)
- Keeping the nav bar (logo + pages) centered for tablet and mobile (Instead of left aligned)
- Making sure site doesn't scroll outside the mobile window (it's like the site shifts b/c of the nav bar)
- Centering the logo within the footer
- I'm gonna be out of town till Sunday, so i'll be offline till then.

Thank you in advance!


a lot of the divs have inline styles so the style sheet won't override those styles.
