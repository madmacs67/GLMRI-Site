Dan Notes

to have images, specifically HERO SVGs, not have scroll bars in IE, you could use a style called "overflow" with a value of "visible"


Change this 
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, user-scalable=true;">
to
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">


hero size scaling across different page widths:
	#hero > object {
		height:55%; /* change this value */
	}


	fonts in columns
	make the size a percentage:     font-size: 85%;


	leading and kerning
    line-height: 62px;
    letter-spacing: 0.01em;
